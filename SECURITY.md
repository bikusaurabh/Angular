# Security Policy

This project is meant as a sample, that can also be used as a starting point for your own implementation.
It is meant as _inspiration_ and we advise the reader to use their own judgement and security analysis when using the code herein.

Security updates are not done very regularly.
But if you do want to see an issue get fixed, here's how to go about it.

## Reporting an issue

To report a (potential) security problem _with the sample_, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/sample-angular-azure-devops/issues).
Please note that we are not able to give individual projects or spin-offs from this sample.
